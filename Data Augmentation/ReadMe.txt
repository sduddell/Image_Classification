Deep neural networks require a large dataset but it is not always possible to have a big dataset while solving real problems. So, we use data augmentation to generate new images either by flipping, resizing, zooming the images.
This folder includes a simple example on how to deal with less number of images. This file has a model to classify the basic problem of dogs and cats. There are only 40 training and 20 testing images. I have implemented data augmentation using keras to generate images with various sizes or scales etc. 
Please note that this code is not similar to other "cats and dogs" data augmentation codes, methods like flow_from_directory and flow(x,y) are not used.
